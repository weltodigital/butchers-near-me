Based on our previous data addition, these Bedfordshire pages should show butchers:

URLs to check:
- /bedfordshire/bedford (should have The Meat Market, Bedford Butchers)
- /bedfordshire/luton (should have Luton Butchers, Quality Meats Luton)
- /bedfordshire/dunstable (should have Dunstable Family Butchers)
- /bedfordshire/leighton-buzzard (should have Buzzard Butchers)
- /bedfordshire/biggleswade (should have Village Butcher)
- /bedfordshire/sandy (should have Sandy Meat Co)
- /bedfordshire/ampthill (should have Ampthill Traditional Butchers)
- /bedfordshire/flitwick (should have Flitwick Butchers)

Issues to check:
1. Did you run the fix-public-butchers-view-properly.sql in Supabase?
2. Are the city slugs matching between locations and butchers?
3. Is the website caching old data?
4. Are there console errors in the browser/server?

Next steps:
1. Run debug-butchers.sql in Supabase to check data
2. Clear browser cache / restart dev server
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify city slug matching
